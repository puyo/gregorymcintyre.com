			<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>I have filled various roles as needed in technical teams within
			small businesses, including programmer, project manager, systems
			administrator and software architect. I have a well developed sense
			of the roles, responsibilities and behaviours that constitute a
			productive software team.</p>
			<h3>Project Management</h3>
			<p>I managed systems for time accounting and issue tracking (RT,
			Trac, Jira). I believe in maximising project visibility and
			accountability without sacrificing its autonomy.</p>
			<h3>Software Architecture</h3>

			billing system to calculate call costs and reverse lookups for
			prepaid mobile billing. At Tilefile Ltd, I was lead architect on a
			media rich web application.</p>
			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<p>I adhere to the <em>right tool for the job</em> philosophy. I am
			always learning more programming languages, libraries and
			frameworks, with a tendency toward open source and freely available
			technologies that I can obtain and learn at home. I am comfortable
			with making technology adoption decisions.</p>
