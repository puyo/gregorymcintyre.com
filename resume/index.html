			<h2>Career Objective</h2>
			<p>To produce useful, quality software as a pragmatic software
			engineer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section skills">
			<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>I have a track record of filling different roles as needed in
			technical teams within small businesses, including programmer,
			project manager, systems administrator and software architect and
			as such I have a well developed sense of the roles,
			responsibilities and behaviours that constitute a professional,
			productive software team.</p>
			<h3>Project Management</h3>
			<p>I have commercial experience managing systems for time
			accounting and issue tracking (RT, Trac, Jira). I believe in
			maximising project visibility and accountability without
			sacrificing its autonomy.</p>
			<h3>Software Architecture</h3>
			<p>At Symbio Networks Pty Ltd, I helped architect a telephone
			billing system to calculate call costs and reverse lookups for
			prepaid mobile billing. At Tilefile Ltd, I was lead architect on a
			media rich web application.</p>
			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<p>I believe in the <em>right tool for the job</em> philosophy and
			have deliberately studied and exposed myself to a broad range of
			programming languages, libraries and frameworks, with a tendency
			toward open source and freely available technologies that I can
			obtain and learn at home. I am comfortable with making technology
			adoption decisions.</p>
