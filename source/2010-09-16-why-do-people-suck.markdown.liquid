title: "Why Do People Suck?"
---

Owly’s question: Why do people suck?  
Foxie’s word: Decoupage.

{%poem GM%}
Why do people suck so much?
    Like parents who let their children run rings
    Around them and touch exhibited things?
Why do people suck so much?
    Like people who try to rhyme the word eye
    With the clearly non-rhyming “symme-try”?
Why do people suck so much?
    Like pop art decoupage kitschy freaks
    Who paint sun faces and do shabby chic?
Why do people suck so much?
    Like hipsters.
