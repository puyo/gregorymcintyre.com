title: "What Was Made at 40 Ks"
---

{%poem GM%}
The instant I looked at you, the rush!
My next crush, you telegraphed
Your laugh right past my guard.
I didn't stand a chance - was lanced,
Upon my train seat by romance.

You saw my trance in fluorescent light
A thousand mem'ries yet to prove
Flickered through my inner sight.
My fingers on my keyboard halted,
Mind assaulted by your smile.

Yeah... it's been a while,
Since I saw a hurt like mine
Broken by a facial line.

Your stoicism on the floor
Rolled around like an empty can
Nobody was going to claim.
Who could blame? What was made
In that moment at 40 Ks
Was something better, something more,
Something we'd both been waiting for.
