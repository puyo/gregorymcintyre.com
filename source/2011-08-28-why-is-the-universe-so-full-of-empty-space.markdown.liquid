title: "Why is the Universe So Full of Empty Space?"

Question: Why is the universe so full of empty space?  
Word: Audacious

{%poem GM%}
The universe is full of empty space
Yet you'd prefer, to keep apace
With the Jones' universe, next door,
A universe with something more?

I implore you to consider
The audacious questions you deliver.
Your backyard full of junk?
Keep it to yourself, you punk.
