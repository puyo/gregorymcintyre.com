```poem
You found me once
Cooing like a koel

You gave me
Would you like a cup of teas
And
Thought of you todays

You gave me
Do you want to come overs
And
Chin up smiles

You gave me
Bark and red seeds
And
Waking up the neighbours

You gave me
Somebody worth loving dearly
And
To give my time and trouble

I'm so happy now
No coo
Rises from me mornings
No plaintive cry escapes me

I've exactly what I want
Dearest
Thank you thank you
You knew just what to give

Your quieted koel
```
