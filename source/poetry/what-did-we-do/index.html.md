```poem
What did we do, when I showed you
You don't love me, and nor I you?
You smile and cook and ask after my day
But seldom pause for what I say.

And I return, in kind to you.
I give my life, to stay in view.
I smile and clean and wash and shop
But when you speak my efforts stop.

What did we do, when I showed you
You don't love me, and nor I you?
You went upstairs and cleaned the rooms
And in silence, I cleaned too.

What else to say and what to do?
You don't love me, and nor I you.
```
