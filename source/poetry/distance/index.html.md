```poem
I recall a time long ago
Sunkissed sands and holidays
When we played and napped and smiled

Long time ago

Before we grew up and werenâ€™t allowed to anymore
No time
No cash
Before the marriage and the job and the work-a-day week and the phone calls and the bills and the everything

Before winters, like cold stones, piled up

	I think you left your car keys on the table in the hall.
	Anyway.

I think we were happy once
```
