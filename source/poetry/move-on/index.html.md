```poem
Join the escalator rush
Human smells, a fluoro crush
Trolleys filled with plastic shit
Get shitted out near the car park lift

Kids beg ice cream, beg play dates
One parent capitulates
Move on people, move along
Moving on, I move right on

Giant hair and teeth stare down, man, colossal, risks collapse

Back lit slender hips and skin, bikini clad wall, shivering

Gold rings gold things, pinstripe man, gold tooth grin, golden hand

Donuts donuts donuts, jam, beef and chicken, cheese and ham

Moving on, I move along
Moving's good
I move
Slip round
A bend
Exhale
Now a respite
From
SALE SALE SALE

What looks like books
A refuge, I take it
I wander isles of ink on crisp paper
Pencils, pens and tiny staplers
Breathe normally
Stale stationery air
I stay
I stay

Resolutely there
```
