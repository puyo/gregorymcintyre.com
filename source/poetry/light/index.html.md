```poem
even red rheumy eyes
or winter stones piled
even crow's eulogies
are ephemeral energies
transubstantiated matter
on a voyage interstellar

even the branch from the poplar
fell on that man in the paper
the heft of it, three storms ago
broke his sternum, squished his toe
mostly empty, did he know?
energy compacted
starlight refracted
destination selected
pooled and collected

down down
light descended
from a random twinkling star
upon him bone and brick
as his throat grew thick
mostly empty, did he know?
```
