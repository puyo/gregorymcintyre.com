```poem
Tackle bears!
Deliver!
Impress!
Go team
We'll scream!
Dream big and gamble!
Win!
We'll laugh
We'll spend our evenings
Boozing and wheezing
'Round the city and stealing
Time from the clock
We'll go out on yachts
Drive fast cars
Eat the stars
Flip bills at fast women in bars

Shut up, I think
Take your morning dump
In some other heap
This company's carpet tiles
Are miles from your
Bikini-clad shores
No-one believes you, you twat
No-one wants that
What's your damage?
Take your ritual and shove it
Find some other tortured habitual
```
