```poem

WASH MY FUCKIN' HANDS???

YOU reprimand ME
YOU dare to demand ME
ME, who paid taxes
To get TWO FUCKIN' VAXES
And scan a QR code
Before I can go load
My trolley with Solo
Double salted prosciutto
Sebago
Potatoes
Two kilos
Brushed white?

IT'S MY SOVEREIGN FUCKIN' RIGHT
To blow bits of spittle
To push past you pitiful
Pimply teenager
Stanning dictators
Your rules are for sheeple
Not for sovereign people

Call your manager, go on
I'll punch on and prove wrong
He's a communist, hold on
He'll sing a brand new song

I'm a citizen under the law
You want more? See this flyer
I got from the net for you liars
PROOF TRUMP'S THE MESSIAH!!!!!!

Masks make you gasp
Can't your puny mind
Grasp how you ask
A elder, a man of my age
Who worked hard for a living
Who brought home a wage-
To-
To-
Hnnnn

His face turns to ash and he clutches his chest
And what happens next is probably for the best

```
