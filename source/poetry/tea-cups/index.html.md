Harry and Nicola: focus on an object
```

```poem
what would Scandi TV detectives say
if they came to the house while we were away?

they'd wear trench coats and hardened faces
they'd measure the distance in detective paces
from the front door to your bags on the floor
they'd photograph the corridor

they'd note our tea cups nestled together
the doona imprints, the inclement weather,
the line of clothes to the bedroom door
where they'd photograph a little more

one would shoot the other a look
the other'd respond in kind
would he arch a single brow
or would it just be in his mind?

no murders here, they'd close their books
just two lovers by the looks
```
