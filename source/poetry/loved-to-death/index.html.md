```poem

Oh, much loved soldier
In dog saliva
Oh, heroic sewn soldier
With mystery stains
Oh, stripey brown warrior
At the end of your tether
Oh, smiling grim champ
Oh, rope filled brave

Duty to the last
We honour your past
Your squeaky head where he did cleave-ya
Oh, nondescript mammal
In your hard spit enamel
What even are you? Like, a beaver?

```
