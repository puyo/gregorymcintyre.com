Harry and Nicola: Strange fruit
```

```poem
Lying around, we talked about our favourite songs
We watched one with kabuki masks spinning towards the screen
Terrifying
A woman sitting on a giant leaf eating a red powder
Powder on her fingers
Powder on her tongue

Lyrics like

  Take the heat
  I don't trust
  Those wild horses

It was about a father wanting his daughter to shoot her rapists
It changed key and I woke up weeping
```
