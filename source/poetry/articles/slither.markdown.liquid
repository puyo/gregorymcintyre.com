Petulia’s word: Slither

June’s question: How many turns are you supposed to take around the
mulberry bush?
{%endprompt%}

{%poem GM%}
My lipsss I am a-lickin’ when the childrens come a-pickin’
Round my home they are a-dancin’, a-ssshoutin’ and a-prancin’.
I likes the taste of little boysss, dislocate my jaws and poisssse,
To ssslither out and pluck one where he
Circles ’round my mulberry bush,
Clumsy, slow, and none too wary.
{%endpoem%}
