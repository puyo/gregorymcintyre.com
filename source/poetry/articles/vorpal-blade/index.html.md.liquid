Word: Vorpal Blade

Question: What makes you happy?
{%endprompt%}

{%poem GM%}
Daggers make me giggle,
And staves make me colour.
Polearms are a tickle,
And axes, if they're duller.

Swords are not as sharp,
As my rogueish wit.
Even if I harp,
On about dice a bit.

Arrows make me smirk,
As long as I evade,
Your precious 1d8 + 1 dirk?
Holds nothing to my Vorpal Blade.
