```prompt
Paulina: What is an anteater's fast food?

Ariel: battery
```

```poem
At twenty-something (in human years), I
Can no longer eat five thousand ants
Without a commensurate amount a time,
Jogging in anteater sweat pants.

``Oh don't worry,'' they say, ``You'll find you are
Hugely passionate for it one day!
It releases endorphins that are at least on par
With a honeypot souffl√©.''

``It recharges your battery, removes all your fears,
Makes the girl anteaters' hearts pang!
Adds years to your life,'' Yeah. Human years.
So I have to multiply that by twenty-six and divide by eighty. Dang.
```
