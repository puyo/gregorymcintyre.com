{%poem%}

This love affair is gallery stares
It moves at gallery paces
Wide eyed, bedroom-still
We study each other's faces

This love affair is a sweet duet
Timed exactly right
Shivering like two strings plucked
Two notes for a warm Spring night

This love affair is the words in a book
Bold and lovingly penned
Unfolding and unfurling
Beginning, middle and end

{%endpoem%}
