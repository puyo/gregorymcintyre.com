Owly's word: Transubstantiation

Marian's question: Why does she always scamper away?
{%endprompt%}

{%poem GM%}
My Roman Catholic hamster is never very far but
It's never very clear,
Why she scampers when I near.

I hold out her food. I call her sweet name.
``Whiskers, look! I got you nice,
The Body and the Blood of Christ!''

Yesterday I figured out why she fusses.
The food for her I'd refrigerated
She prefers pretransubstantiated.
