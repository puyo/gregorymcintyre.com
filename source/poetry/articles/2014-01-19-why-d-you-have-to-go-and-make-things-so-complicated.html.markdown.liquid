title: Why'd You Have To Go and Make Things So Complicated?
---

{%poem%}
Dear atheists, why
Do you think the sky
Is falling
Cos people
Dig steeples?
It's galling
Occam's Razor's not cool
When fools
Forget
It's a heuristic tool
To rate
Your ideas
Not hate on your
Peers
Even if
They're God fearing swill
Take a pill
Please chill
Don't let bigotry
Run uphill
