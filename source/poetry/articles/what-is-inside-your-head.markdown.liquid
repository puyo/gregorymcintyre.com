Ginger Jorgental: What is inside your head?
{%endprompt%}

{%poem GM%}
The snow curls to the ground and holds your gaze,
Your eyes, alive and white,
Reflected in the window, by the fire,
On these wint'ry nights.

I'll never ask you to explain,
I hope I never find,
Please never tell me, never lessen with words,
Your quiet heart and mind.
{%endpoem%}
