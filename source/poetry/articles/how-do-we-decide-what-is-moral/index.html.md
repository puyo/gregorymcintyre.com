Question: How do we decide what is moral?

Word: Peter Principle
```

```poem
Yesterday I had a performance review,
And seeing as how it was long overdue,
I got a promotion to “Ultra Pooh Bah
King of the World and Importantest Tzar,
Ruler of All who Doth Canst See-eth Me
(And Decider of All Morality)”
So now that I'm the headest honcho,
The strippers and booze that you said, “Had to go”?
They're by the book, they're protocol now!
Oh don't look like that, you silly old cow.
All your boring old rot about equality's not
How the world works, besides which you're not even that hot.
```
