{%poem GM%}
Does the General of Liberty Street have PTSD?
Did you think of that, Araboolies?
With your kitschy junk and your animal funk
You're disturbing the General's sleep!

Sure he's a mean old guy
And the kids on the street have to hide
But you drove him out of his very own house
Not a chance of a compromise!

I don't believe in baddies, do you?
Just folks who are singing the blues
So next time you encounter a face that is sour,
Stop and think about what he's gone through.
