{%poem GM%}

Too long I've layered brick on brick
And built a house in which to sit
And put the strongest into it:
People that I adore.

My house could weather any storm
And though my roof was holed and worn,
My fireplace was always warm,
And open was my door.

I was as far as I could see
Doing rather capably
Until one day a storm did free
Me from my set of walls.

Now in this dark and quiet street,
It's time I curled up at His feet,
Apologised for my conceit,
And cried,
And cried some more.
