{%poem GM%}
My door creaks
When you go away
It bemoans your departure
Even as it severs me from laughter and light

My eyes close
When you go away
They jealously guard
The arch of your eyebrow and your reposed form

Your image dissolves
When you go away
It eventually succumbs
To the midnight canvas of my inner eye

My lips smile
When you go away
Each time on that weathered old canvas
I discover a new star twinkling warmly
