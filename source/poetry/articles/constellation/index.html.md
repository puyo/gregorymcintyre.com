```poem
My door creaks
When you go away
It moans as you leave
It closes on laughter and light

My eyes close
When you go away
They helplessly hold
The arch of your eyebrow and your reposed form

Your face fades
When you go away
It disintegrates
Into the midnight expanse of my inner eye

My lips smile
When you go away
Each time on that clear cold sky
I find a new star you left behind just for me
```
