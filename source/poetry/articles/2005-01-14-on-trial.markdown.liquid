title: On Trial

{%poem GM%}
Cows in the corner curled up like a turd,
Piss and shit and vomit he is.
Clutches at limbs, this way and that,
Hairy and greasey and selfish and fat.

Leaves burning marks and searing pains,
Where ever he clutches her.
Locks all the doors and kills her, as good,
By loving her utterly, as he should.
