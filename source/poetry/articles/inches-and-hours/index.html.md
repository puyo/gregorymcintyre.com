```poem
Shifting warmth
Low exposure smiles
Inches apart
Small hour calm

Weights and surfaces
Traversing touches
Faint potentials
A love, made to fit

Scenes, little close ups
Lips, hair, liminal airs
Still lifes in pillow forts
Dimly lit shorts

Between lens changes
Interleaved sensations
Little pockets of time
We film with our eyes
```
