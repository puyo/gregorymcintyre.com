title: Words... With Friends Skills
---

{%poem GM%}
She folds her warmth over mine. 
Brush of hair, her neck inclines. 
Ankles cross-uncross once more. 
Tapered wrists twist to the floor. 
A cold white glow winks in her hands. 
Elbows flex and fingers dance. 

``Yesss,'' she says, ``Another S!''
She's playing Words With Friends, I guess.
Oh, my sense of dignity!
I really wish she'd get off me.

``Babe'' she says, ``What ends with X---''
I vaguely hear, ``What ends with sex?''
Her voice continues distantly,
``---and has three letters and an E?''
``I don't know.'' Tex-Mex T-rex
Flecks specks pecks checks.
``How about *vex*?''
She tenses for an second now,
Intense activity, head bowed.
A brighter shade of night, a sound.
She slips and slithers, turns around,
Her hips and knees lock down my chest.
``Babe?'' she says, ``You are the best!''
She starts to move. ``Now your reward
``For the fifty points that I just scored.''
