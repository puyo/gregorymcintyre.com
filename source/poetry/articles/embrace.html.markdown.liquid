{%poem GM%}
I am sitting alone,
But if my eyes wander shut,
Just as my eyelids touch each other,
I feel the warmth of your shoulder,
Folded into mine,
Your hair, brushing my lips,
Your voice at my ear,
In intimate tones,
Mourning the hour,
And the commitment you made to be elsewhere.

Your embrace has lasted for days.
