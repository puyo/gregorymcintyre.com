```prompt
Larisa’s word: Felicity

Gailyana’s question: Are your shoes comfortable?
```

```poem
It took an age to sculpt these shoes.
We’re felicitous. It’s remiss of us,
Not to care for your feet like shoe makers should.
We’re solicitous of your business.

Can we massage your toes with kittens and roses
And mittens and loofahs and flattering lotions?
Can we rub our noses on your toes and say prayers
Blow warm airs on your heel everywheres?

Can we take off your pants and dance…?
There’s ever a chance, you just might find us
That much more, than you saw us, before.
Let me spell it out for you: You could score.
```
