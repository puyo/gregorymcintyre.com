Paulina's Question: Why do civilisations rise and die?

Word: Bitchy Resting Face
{%endprompt%}

{%poem%}
Hot oily Egyptians
Got frisky with Christiansâ€”
Cleo's dance card was full.
But she turned around
And sadly found
That her temples and libraries were burned to the ground.

Catherine the Great
Left things in a state
That nobody thought could be better.
But her empire got sick
With Archdukes, Bolsheviks,
And BAM, became a soviet socialist republic.

Tzu-hsi's dynasty
Was in dire need
Of a great number of modern reforms.
Her people revolted,
White men got assaulted,
Then a lotta white armies showed up and she bolted.

See, in each of these cases,
It wasn't the traces
Of bitchiness in their ruler's faces.
The reasons were strange,
And the rulers got blamed.
The only thing that's constant is change.
