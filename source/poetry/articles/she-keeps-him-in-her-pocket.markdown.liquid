{%poem GM%}
Where do you keep a boy so gentle,
He might break up and float away?
Somewhere safe away from the starlight.
Somewhere out of harm's way.

Where do you keep a girl so afraid,
Her heart might collapse any day?
Keep her distracted with trivial things
And always having her way.

Take him, take her, in your pocket,
Lock it and throw the key away.
