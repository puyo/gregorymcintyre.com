{%poem GM%}
When the time has come
To step over the mark
And my body is cold
And my future is dark,
I want you along
To show me the way,
To stay and be strong
And make sure I don't stray.

To be sure I don't fall
Into her sway,
I want you to stall
Should I move her way;
To be sure I'm not lost
To my most basic form;
To be sure I'm not tossed
Overboard in the storm.
