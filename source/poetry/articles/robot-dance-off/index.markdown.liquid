Samakaza's question: How do you navigate the waters?

Foxie's word: Robot dance off.

{%poem GM%}
We're nearing the reef. Good grief!
We really need a side to pick.
Quick. You round up all the girl bots.
I have an idea. Let's give it a whirl.
Boys and girls will have a dance off!
Then the chance of the boy bots winning
Will be the same as the wheel left-spinning.
But if the girl bots win the fight
We'll steer this old girl right.
A'right?

Such a plan was very bold
But, all told, the lonely bots upon the shore,
Blowing their ducts with actuators,
Would have to wait
And wait some more.
