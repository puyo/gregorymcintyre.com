```poem
I always hear the same song now,
No matter what is playing,
Because a ghost I met one time
Kept praying, praying, praying.

She sent me an enchanting word
That set my soul in motion.
I returned, all folded up,
Across a midnight ocean.

Dark colossi, frigid winds,
Trees trussed up with lights.
That ghost I met, I met again
Where impossible just might.

I looked in her impossible eyes,
Steeled and amber flecked.
Not all the strength God grants you, ghost,
Arrives as you expect.
```
