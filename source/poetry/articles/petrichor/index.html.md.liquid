{%poem%}

Ah, love,
        sister,
Falling, failing, fragile you.
You knocked on my door and
Told me it's been raining.

Ah, yeah,
        sister,
It's been raining here too.
        And like you
I know how much it costs a heart to commit
To ten thousand more rainy days.

Ah, love,
        Sister,
I'm so happy this secret's not strange.
What? you demand
        Pulled back from afar.
Why, sister you
Of all people know
Just how bloody brave we both are!
