```poem
Everywhere I look the stillness is sick
I can see my death written in it, in it

The end table the doily the iron the nail the mantle the bed the curtain the rail
The exhausted mirror the sliding door the spare bathroom with the tiled floor

Everywhere I look the stillness is sick
I can see my death written in it, in it
```
