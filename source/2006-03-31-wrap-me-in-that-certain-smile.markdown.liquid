title: "Wrap Me In That Certain Smile"
---

{%poem GM%}
Fluorescent lights show us now, sitting in our railway seat.
I wear the office trials of the day.

I get up to let you off, standing on my weary feet.
You thank me and I pale from the way.

Like you know me perfectly, laughing at my spotlight burn.
You alight the train through parting doors.

Wrap me in that certain smile! Wash away the day's concern!
It's all you had to do, and I was yours.

For a moment I was held, cradled in strange charity,
I felt the peace and confidence so dear.

Fluorescent lights show me now, sitting in my railway seat.
An overgrown child, a thin veneer.
