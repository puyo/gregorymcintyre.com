title: "Where Are Your Storage Items Kept?"
---

Writer’s Meet word of the night: Scrutiny  
Ginger Jorgental’s question: Where are your storage items kept?

{%poem GM%}
My undies and socks are in compartmentalised stores,
Situated in drawers, from ceiling to floor.
Under the stairs there’re seventeen more.
My craft cupboard spans an entire wall.
Each bobbin, each pin, a space for them all.

If you care to apply some scrutiny
To my collection of records in the attic you’ll see
I sorted them chromatically.
My winter clothes are in vacuum packs,
My ties and my shoes? Their own special racks!

I’ve a special drawer for my cutlery;
It has separate compartments numbering three.
A tool box, a hat stand, a cupboard, pantry,
A seat box, a toy box, one for costuming,
My passion for storage is all consuming!
