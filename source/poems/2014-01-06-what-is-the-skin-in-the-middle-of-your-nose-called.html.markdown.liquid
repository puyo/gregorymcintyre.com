Amelia Canning's question: Whatâ€™s the skin in the middle of your nose called?
{%endprompt%}


{%poem%}
I want to say phylum but maybe that
Is some Greek sex toy or some Roman hat
I want to say innex but it sounds kind of wrong
Like a preppy bayarea nineties dot com
I want to say pilaf but it sounds too delicious
I want to say nostrum but it feels too contritious
I want to say snotwall, it's the funniest name
I want to say bridge but it's already a game
And a thing that you cross to get over a creek
And hey! it's already a part of your beak
All my life, my nostrils it separately kept 'em
What? Septum? Ha ha no, it's definitely not septum
