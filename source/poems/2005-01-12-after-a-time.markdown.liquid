title: After a Time
---

{%poem GM%}
Past this window, traffic coming,
Sun lit dirty pane, computer humming.
It will all be here after I die.

See these people, busy working,
Talking, walking and conversing.
They will forget me after I die.

Dust motes settle on the floor,
Curtains move gently beside the door.

When I leave it the world will cry,
But the ripples I cause will settle and die,
And loved ones I know will somehow get by.
