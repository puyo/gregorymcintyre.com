title: Eat Me Like One of Your French Fries
---

{%poem%}
her warm chest, against my back.
her arm, it snakes around me.
an empty cardboard sleeve in her,

long

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pale

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fingers

golden arches on a jaunty red.
i inspect it.
cardboard reflected in my,

long

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lashed

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye

i want you to eat me, wearing this
her lips touch my ear.
silk drapes billow, softly.

wearing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this
