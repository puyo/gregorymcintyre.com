title: To His Grave
---

{%poem GM%}
Clinging to a cliff side aerie,
Falling not but very nearly,
Clears his throat and sings out clearly,
``Presently if you can hear me,
Save me for I love life dearly!''
Comes back silence, very eerie.
Peaceful now and without fear he
Lies now where we visit yearly.
