title: Trickles Retreating
---

{%poem GM%}
Trickles retreating through grooves in park seating.
Petals unsettled by wide crying skies.
Fleeting feet mark out wet footsteps.

You know,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for that pair of lovers there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody's enjoying this cold wet air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their camera's pulled out and their teeth are bared;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shivering smiles to be captured and shared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With loved ones who'll try in earnest to care.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is all very nice, I suppose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it's a life that I chose to give up for the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has led me here to this very wet seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can sit on and watch my failings repeat.
