Paulina: What are the daily thoughts of a caterpillar teenager?

Beatnik: groak... it means, to watch people while they're eating and
secretly hope they will invite you to join them.

{%poem GM%}
Butterflies! I roll my eyes!
So ungrounded, they dare advise!
Wafty sermons they totally deal.
LIKE THEY KNOW HOW I FEEL!?

Like they know the pain I go through,
Far away watching her every chew
That leaf I glimpse on a neighbouring tree.
Only Robert Smith truly understands me.

When you want to swap leaves for a chick it's called “groaking,”
My mates say “bros before hos,” provoking.
They know I'm about to give up
Make like a fly and butter me up.
