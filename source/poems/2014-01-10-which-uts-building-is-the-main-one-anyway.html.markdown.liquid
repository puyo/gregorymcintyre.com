title: Which UTS Building Is the Main One Anyway?
---

{%poem%}
To this meet I am goin'
Geoff's throwin'
With Rain
It's at this place that's kinda hard to explain
It's a style of building you don't see a lot
If you're not from Telstra or the communist bloc
This darkly stained tower where we hold our meet?
Is a mixture of Kubrick and browned cobblecrete
You guessed it, it's your favourite, it's the UTS tower
But is it the true seat of UTS power?
