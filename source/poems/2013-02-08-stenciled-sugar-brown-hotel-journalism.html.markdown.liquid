{%poem GM%}
What happened to you
Dear heart? Your life was
Thrown in with the colours
And you pulled the door shut behind you.
After all,

Tumbled was better than being out there.

But how disastrous! How unkind!
The ideas in your pen ran out in the wash.
Your momentum changed, and rearranged
Into chaos and darkness.

When at last, heralded by the helpful chime
Of time being up,
You emerged a woman,
Smaller than you were before.
