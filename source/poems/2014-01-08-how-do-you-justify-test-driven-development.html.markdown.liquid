title: How Do You Justify Test Driven Development?
---

{%poem%}
On test driven development, opinions vary
So let me give you some advice for the wary
Performance? It's easy as to convey
You can run some numbers and see what they say
UX? It's subtle but quick to effect
And you'll get lotsa smiles from the users you met
Following a style guide and conveying intent?
You'll see straight away mismatching indents!
But how do you teach how it feels to be free
Of staying back late to fix bug 93?
How do you convey in actual words
When the software you write actually actually works?
