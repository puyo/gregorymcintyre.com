title: "Genius Bar Evictee"

Sam’s word: Boing.  
Polly’s question: Where do babies come from?

{%poem GM%}
Genius bar evictee,
That’s me.
They did not agree
With pedagogical duty:
The use of iMovie
To explain to thee
Making a baby.
See,
I placed spy cameras ’round
Without sound
Recorded, played, rewound
Yet found
The idea wasn’t clear
So here,
And there
I put a sound.
To expound, I did it,
I admit it,
I clicked edit
And you bet it
Sounded good
Last night…
But now
An imagined voice sounds clear and right.
“Royce,” it says, in mother’s voice,
“Maybe <em>'boing'</em> was not the best choice.”
