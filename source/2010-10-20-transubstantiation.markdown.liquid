Owly's word: Transubstantiation  
Marian's question: Why does she always scamper away?

{%poem GM%}
My Roman Catholic hamster is never very far but
It's never very clear,
Why she scampers when I near.

I hold out her food. I call her sweet name.
"Whiskers, look! I got you nice,
The Body and the Blood of Christ!"

Yesterday I figured out why she fusses.
The food for her I'd refrigerated
She prefers pretransubstantiated.
