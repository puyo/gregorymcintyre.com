# Background

Please consult the *Hoard of the Dragon Queen* campaign book. These notes
supplement and alter that work.

*The players start as children in a forest tree house village named Rikrok.*
Rikrok is entirely populated by orphans with hazy memories of life before the
forest, memories of wars and tears.

*Rikrok is a safe place where children play and learn.* Surrounding the
village are thick brambles preventing the children from leaving and bad things
from getting in, even across the shallow stream of fresh water that wanders
through the village.

*The children are looked after by a teenager named Daphne (the oldest of the
children) and a mysterious wolf.* The **Giant Wolf** leaves food, toys, and
equipment on a large flat rock in the sunlight each morning. The children
occupy themselves with singing and playing songs on instruments found on the
rock (Daphne is a talented musician, a **Bard** whose songs make the children
feel warm, safe and sleepy), they play and drink in the stream, they play fight
with wooden weapons, they stage ambushes and sling mud at one another, some
read books found on the rock, and at dinner they all sit together and eat
around a campfire to eat.

> Each player's preferred play is suitable for their level 1 class of choice.
> Fighters play fight and stage duels and battles, while Wizards find
> fascinating books on the rock and enjoy reading them and attempting cantrips,
> for example. For the first session, the players are level 0 and have
> only one cantrip, weapon, or ability indicative of their class.

**The Stork.** Periodically, a large stork brings a child to the village. Some
of the older children recall it flying overhead. When a new child arrives, it
comes swaddled in fresh clothing and bedding. Over the next few days, new toys,
books and clothing tend to arrive on the rock, clearly intended for the new
child.

**The Wolf.** The large wolf is huge and terrifying to the children but they
have learned that it means them no harm. It seems very intelligent and kind,
although all attempts to befriend it have failed. They carve wooden wolf
effigies as necklaces and leave them as an offering on the rock.

**The Animals.** Various animals live in the forest. Sometimes the children
notice them watching intently, or skulking about. When the children try to
interact, the animals tend to flee out of sight.

**The Light on the Hill.** At night time, light and smoke as from a cooking
fire appear above a hill outside of the border of the village.

> The stork and the wolf are animal forms of a level 10 high elf druid named
> Faeghear. After his adventuring party was killed, Faeghear took one of their
> daughters - an orphan baby Daphne - to the forest to care for. He lives as a
> hermit overlooking the children and only ever interacts with them in animal
> forms, so shy is he. He maintains several spells to conceal and protect the
> village.

# Errata

### Child's perspective

Children don't take notes and will forget all the names of characters. Merge
NPCs. Avoid giving them names when a title or a good descriptor will do.
Otherwise it's just overwhelming.

### Epic scale

Litter the adventure with vast vistas to give a sense of scale. Dragons!

### Villains

There are only a few broad reasons why somebody might work for the dragon cult
that wants to burn the world:

- Fear. Belief that it's inevitable and they'll be spared only if they help.
- Power. Belief that they'll have a place as a leader in the new world order.
- Nihilism. They want to die and to bring the world with them.
- Hubris. They want to raise it so they can fight it or kill it.
- Ignorance. They do not realise what the cult's plan is, but just think
  they're a dragon themed organised crime gang.

### Hoard of the Dragon Queen adjustments

**Episode 1.** Cyanwrath is acting out his birthright as a descendant of the
blue dragon flight. He is Lawful Neutral and honorable in his own way. He is
following orders but he will obey his warrior's code. He despises Frulam and
tries and fails not to show it. He does not know of the plan to raise Tiamat
and he's not smart enough to know what that would mean anyway. He is hard to
convince to cross Frulam due to his strict sense of loyalty, but it's possible.
Not that it is likely to come up.

**Episode 2.** Faeghear is tied up next to Leo, his face burned by Rezmir's
acid. She wanted to find out what the Harpers are doing. Have Leo explain to
the players about that once they've escaped. He is reluctant to tell them
about the Harpers, though.

Have Leo tell the players that the cult plans to raise Tiamat. The NPCs in the
game may not know, however, and even if they find out, they may be very
skeptical that it's even possible, until right at the end when the Red Wizards'
role becomes clearer.

**Episode 3.** Frulam has a terrible past and hates the world and wants
to see it burned. She is incredibly unstable and ill. She may just as soon kill
herself as defeat her enemies. She may die of an unidentified illness anyway.
She does not care about life. The only reason she is leader of the camp is that
her anger and sadness makes her absolutely terrifying, and her magic makes her
strong.

Have her burn a prisoner alive to regain a spell slot or receive a temporary
buff, have her cackles and song echo throughout the cave, have her lay a trap
that hurts both the players and also herself or her underlings (maybe a cave in
to trap them all), have her scream at the players with tears flying.

**Episode 4.** Make Azbara Jos and Rath Modar the same NPC. He has a good back
story and motivation already. If the players try to murder him, he can use
illusion magic to escape. Describe his dodgy appearance and the players will
suspect him. If they see through his disguise and tell anybody, they'll hear
stories of evil Thayans summoning devils and murdering babies. When the murder
happens, have Jamna plant a bloodied knife on him.

Have travellers tell stories of the awful black dragon woman who preceded
them. Make her stomp on a person's head and intimidate people into
accommodation and information. Make her kill a few cultists for laziness.

**Episode 5.** Sneaky episode. The reward for sneaking should not be that the
adventure continues. That just means you HAVE to let them succeed. Instead,
make a master thief break in and steal a really nice magical item of your
choice and nearly make off with it unless the adventurers spot them. That way,
if they sneak well, they'll get a great item, and if they don't, they'll still
find a trapdoor left open.

**Episode 6.** Make Borngray intolerably snobbish and expressive in his
loathing of the bullywugs. If there are elf players, have him only talk to
them.

**Episode 7.** The jump to the castle in the next episode is tenuous so make
Red Wizards the real villain and let Talis be an insubordinate prisoner during
the fight. Have Rath and his cohorts summon a devil to fight the players. Show
how good they are at summoning. While the players fight, the wizards use magic
to escape. Talis can be released and gratefully tells the players how badly
Rezmir treated her (she's missing an ear, burned off by acid), and about the
cloud castle she just went to. In fact, have her give the players her winter
staff if they promise they'll finish her off.

**Episode 8.** Rezmir. Her lust for power is greater than her common sense or
her morals. She gets what she wants by strength. Once she is dealt with, give
the players a chance to acquire the black dragon mask, don't teleport it away.
It's OK. If the cult do not have it, it just means Tiamat will be weaker when
she emerges. Plus the characters will be attacked in the next book several
times so the cult will have a chance to get it back.

Fill this whole castle with gold and treasure. Fill it with as much treasure as
the party can carry. Have them tripping over it. Have them climb a mountain of
gold and wade through gems. The players can take home only as much as they can
carry. Take a break before the next book and let the characters go shopping and
buy one or two magic items of the most expensive sort.

# Session Records

## Session 1. The Wolf, the Hill and the Light

*Aviy* is a halfling girl who loves animals and the forest more than anything.
She has taken to reading old bark bound books containing sketches of vines,
plants, animals, and spells. She has learned to call upon the creepers and
vines of the forest to her aid, which she uses to climb tall trees and impress
her many friends.

*Blue* is a gnomish girl with a few metallic scales on her arms and legs who
has a natural affinity with magic, which she draws out from somewhere inside of
her and commands with occasionally fiery consequences, especially when the
other children are bored enough to antagonise her. She loves her forest home
and gets along especially well with the younger children, but is full of
questions about the scales on her body and the outside world.

---

The players wake to find the children alarmed. A rambunctious child named
Mushka has disappeared.

The players question the other children and discover that Mushka had been
talking with her friend about finding a new gap in the brambles - not
something that has ever happened before - and squeezing through it to
investigate the light on the hill. She left last night and did not return
in the morning.

The children decide to put together a rescue party and follow. The players
pack a lunch and make their way out of the village for the first
time, to the top of the hill.

They overhear guttural speech which surprisingly Blue realises she can
understand. They spy upon two kobolds fighting over a sack of coins outside
a run down hut.

The players scare them away and find Mushka hiding. The curious
children enter the hut to find blood, signs of a struggle, and mess. They
find a bookshelf with a book about dragons open before it. They find a gnarled
quarterstaff decorated with feathers and runes and the wolf necklaces
the children had carved, wrapped in velvet in a drawer.

The find a letter that says "Old friend, your charges are in grave danger. I
need help. Meet me in Greenest, 21 Eleint. Stay off the road! Leo"

The children return to the village and relate what has happened.

Days pass and the wolf that normally brings them food is nowhere to be seen.
Daphne rations their remaining food but is worried. There are more gaps opening
up in the brambles that border the village and beyond them the children can see
giant cobwebs and hear strange wild music.

Because of their successful rescue attempt, the players are nominated to travel
to Greenest and investigate.

> The players are now level 1.

> Leo is Faeghear's Harper friend from a past adventuring life, and one of the
> only people who know of the village. He has asked the Harpers to learn more
> about the children's parentage so that they may one day be reunited with
> their families.

## Session 2. Greenest in Flames

*Whisper* is a half elf ranger who noticed children walking unattended on the
roads and decided to follow them out of curiosity. She barely speaks and when
she does is barely audible, so the children named her Whisper. She is ultra shy
and seems to shun contact with people, preferring to live scavenging and
hunting for food away from civilisation.

---

The players pack and make their way back to the hill. From there, they
descend, away from the village, following the general direction of tracks as
best they can.

The trees grow more sparse. The players skirt a large black keep with a
foreboding feeling.

Following the stream, the children emerge onto fields and find a road with a
signpost that says Greenest on it. They follow the road but stay off it,
through open country past smouldering empty farm buildings.

As they reach Greenest they find it under attack! A large blue dragon soars
overhead, seen between plumes of smoke from fires raging.

The players fight their way into the town (Aviy traps the kobold's feet in
vines while Blue blasts them with magic) and find kobolds entering the houses
and looting.

Aviy rescues a woman fighting off kobolds while Blue helps her husband and
children clear a path to the safety of the keep.

Once inside the keep, the children meet the governor and offer to help.

The players sneak through a tunnel and manage to rescue a group of townsfolk
trapped in a church that kobolds and cultists are trying to set fire to. To
their astonishment, arrows from the trees felled several of the kobolds and the
half elf that fired them joins them and helps them silently. They have a good
feeling about her.

Once the townsfolk are safe in the keep, a blue dragon man walks up and
barks a challenge, offering prisoners in exchange for a duel with Greenest's
finest warrior.

The governor sends his best guard and Aviy and Blue make a deal with the
dragon man: they will assist in the duel, and he may elect two more to
assist him. He laughs and picks two lowly kobolds, confident that he will
win even without them.

The duel is brutal and the guard is knocked to the ground several times.
Aviy calls upon the the magic of nature to heal the guard repeatedly but
it is all he can do to stand up again before the towering blue dragon man
cuts him back down. Aviy and Blue shoot arrows and magic at the blue dragon
man until he strides over to them and knocks them down with the flat of his
blade. They notice that he could have killed them, but did not! He nods
at them honorably and limps away, bloodied, climbs atop the adult blue
dragon and flies away while the other enemy forces retreat with wagonloads
of the town's goods and gold.

> The players are now level 2.

## Session 3: Forest Friendships

The players sleep and recover in Greenest. They cannot find Whisper.

The governor, at first doubtful of children, sees now that they are able to
look after themselves with magic. Wary of non-humans staying in Greenest, he
instead offers them a gold reward if they sneak after the invading army and
come back and report their location and activities.

The players agree, but first they decide to travel back to Rikrok to check
on the other children. The family they rescued cook them lots of food
including berry muffins and they ride horses back the same way they came.

The forest where Rikrok is hidden is full of potential adventure. To the
southwest are giant spiders and an ettercap. To the northeast there is a
tribe of satyrs. To the northwest there is a dryad fighting with human
loggers. To the north there is a small family of wolfwares.

Back in Rikrok, the children look worried, dirty and thin. They eat hungrily
and are impressed by the horses and new spells and abilities the players
demonstrate.

Mushka reveals that she followed the players to Greenest. She is dirty, starving,
and wounded by a sling bullet which Aviy heals. She waves about a bow she
found and demonstrates by firing it. She shows off by hiding from them. She
insists that she is strong and can come with them and help. Blue refuses.
Mushka promises she will not follow them but hides her crossed fingers.

Daphne expresses concern that the might not be enough food without the wolf's
help so the children explore the forest looking for food.

Deep in the forest, they find a beautiful woman with tan skin and leaves
growing out of her head like hair. She identifies Aviy as a friend and
asks them if they care about the forest. Of course they do! She asks them
to go stop some humans nearby from chopping down the trees. If they do
this, she says, she will give them something that will help the other
children.

The players find a family of loggers nearby who are stunned and worried
for the players' welfare. Hearing about a village of children in the
forest, they demand that they come and rescue the children. Blue works
hard to convince them that is not a good idea and tells them to stop
chopping trees. Angered at their impudence, the loggers restrain the
children. Fearful of a magical being in the forest, they demand to know how
they are meant to earn money if they stop chopping trees. The players send an
animal messenger to the leaf haired woman to pose this question. They
receive a reply back that they may chop only the oldest trees and only
on their side of the river. In exchange, the leaf haired woman will not
enchant them and make them kill each other. Satisfied for now with this
truce, they are glad to see the players leave.

The leaf haired woman gives the players a seed and says that if they plant it
in nice soil, it will grow a special plant that will regrow its fruit every
morning. The children do so and stay the night back in Rikrok.

That night, Blue is tempted into the forest by the sounds of music playing
and her desperate curiosity. Aviy follows her.

In the forest they find a satyr playing a pan pipe that seems to sound like ten
instruments. He laughs at them and decides to befriend these innocent
children. He waves his hands and reveals many other satyrs sitting around a
meal nearby all playing their instruments. The whole terrain is different
to what Blue thought it was before. Amused, the satyr offers to teach Blue
a magic spell as long as she promises to play a prank with it and return
and tell them how it went. Blue agrees, and he teaches her Minor Illusion.

Aviy asks for a spell too. Because she is a friend to the forest, the satyr
teaches her Dancing Lights but thinks little of it.

The satyr party grows rowdy with dancing and drinking, and illusion spells
flying around that are both joyous and scary. Aviy grows scared of them so
the players leave.

> The players are now level 3.

## Session 4. Path to the Raider's Camp

Confident that Rikrok now has enough food, the players ride back to Greenest
and south to follow the tracks left by the retreating army days ago.

They encounter cult members camped on the road and open fire from afar with
their bows and magic, dispatching them easily.

## Session 5. Raider's Camp

Continuing into rocky terrain, the adventurers fail to spot an ambush and are
captured and brought to a large tent where Frulam, Rath, Rezmir and Cyanwrath.

They are immediately identified as the defenders sent out onto the field of
Greenest. Rezmir sentences them to execution in the morning. They are taken and
strapped up next to Leosin and Faeghear. Leo says he meant to be captured, to
learn more about the cult, but he is badly beaten.

They have a whispered conversation with Leo and listen to his plan to escape.

In the night, Faeghear turns into a snake and delivers a hidden knife from
Leo's boot into his hand where he frees himself and then the others. They have
five minutes between guard checks.

Leo sneaks off to capture an elf cultist to tie up and leave in his stead as a
decoy.

Blue and Aviy sneak into a tent to recover their belongings. They accidentally
wake the guards but dispatch one before he rouses himself and are aided with
the other by the snake.

When they return to where they left Leo, they see him knock out a few
strategically positioned cultists and drag them into the shadows, to help clear
a way for them all to escape.

They fight kobolds near the entrance to the camp that are guarding their
horses and quickly ride away before the camp is alerted.

They escape and make their way back to Greenest. Leo asks the players where
they are from and nods smiling as they explain. He knows about Rikrok but he
does not say. Faeghear remains in the shadows, hood pulled down.

Leo explains to the players what he knows about the dragon cult. They plan to
raise Tiamat, an evil dragon god!

> The players are now level 4.
