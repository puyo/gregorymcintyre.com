```poem
Dad, do trees have babies?
Oh baby I will tell you how! Right now!
With seeds and bees and breezes and lube
I think. I'll check it later on YouTube.

Do they have a wedding ring?
They've got more rings than you've got things.

Do they read their children bedtime stories?
Only one and very boring.

What is it about?
About as boring as a Vikram Seth.
About as long as a director's cut.

A Vick Ram Seat? An ector-cut?
Oh never mind. You know, I find,
More and more, when children are
A part of yours, you just decide
You become the phlegmatic vainglorious centre of the world and it still doesn't help you use the word serendipity.
```
