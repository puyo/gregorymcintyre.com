Vel Alchemi's question: Are you still having costume problems?

Writer's Meet Word: Jaunt
```

```poem
I didn't mean to flaunt it
On our jaunt. It's just that
Sometimes jacket packets
Bought in stores contain some more
Than just the jacket.

See, jackets go over pants
And if nice designers chance
To put jacket tails on some pants
In their packet with the jacket
Then an unsuspecting beau,
As pure as the driven snow,
Could unwittingly unpack it—
Now a folder with a jacket—
And to his outfit, add it.

WHAM.

Now he's in a jam because he
Used his underpants slot for leg hair
And with his pants no longer there,
Just some jacket tails aren't enough
To cover all his stuff.

And cold air can be rough.
