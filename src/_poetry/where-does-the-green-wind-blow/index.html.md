```prompt
June's question: Where does the green wind blow?

Marian's word: Bridge
```

```poem
Under bridge and overpass,
Icy playgrounds after dark,
Rusty shacks in forgotten lands,
Cars in ditches by desert sands,
Surf blasted coves near holiday homes,
Glimpsed from bright roads when alone,
The branches of figs, muscle bound and wet,
Wrestling and struggling dark silhouettes.
```
