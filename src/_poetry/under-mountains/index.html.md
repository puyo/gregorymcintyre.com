```poem
months of coldest stone and trouble
insects buzz in heads and struggle
retreating into bed defeated
fleeing into night time sheets

under mountains no clock ticks
but thickness thins and pain abates
in under mountain passage pass
arrive again to test our task

this morning ride in shining dawn
with horses drawn and standards flown
our enemies in no line can hold
and we are glad and warm and bold
```
