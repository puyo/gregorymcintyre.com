```poem

Since lockdown ended I've
Lain in the deep end and
Looked up to see you
A tangle of limbs

Light bounces like rainbows
Your kind face refracted
Perfect teeth but beneath
Bent this way and that

Distant squeals of delight
Friends chase friends and hunt you
Warm sun summer partner
They're calling you now

```
