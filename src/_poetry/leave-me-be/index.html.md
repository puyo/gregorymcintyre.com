```poem
Take roses and satin
Take rings and vows
Take Pachelbel's Canon
Fire the fucking thing into the sea

It’s not me, love
I’m frigid and thistles
I’m unbearable
Summers and too long winters

Take ribbons and flowers
Take maidens in towers
Take kittens and loofahs away from me

But if you see
Lipstick on his collar
If your stomach drops ten feet
Pick up the phone
I’m always at home
Pick up the phone and call me
```
