```poem
Consider it a creative constraint
*Not* to light the fire
When the mind goes blank and the ink runs dry
Let the *shivering* inspire

Consider it a creative constraint
To *dance* while penning words
Of your admissions of childhood shame
Of turmoil, and butchered birds

Consider it a creative constraint
Unlike a common *amateur*
To incite revolt against the PM
In *strictest* iambic pentameter

Consider it a creative constraint
To finish this poem before the chance
The too-much-tea you drank at lunch
Makes another appear-ance

Consider it a creative constraint
To include footnotes in the structure of rhyme
An avant-garde suggestion you’ll find
Is an idea *well* before its time

Consider it a creative constraint
From the burning mulberry *don’t* flee
Address the root and branch on hot singed paper
If I may recommend, quite rapidly

Consider it a creative constraint
To write a poem with pretty shitty meter, at least one dodgy rhyme and no real conclusion
```
