```poem

how's it going with that new chick?

  the plot is thick
  she is intrigue itself
  like me, she's a poet!
  her angles sublime
  in time I will woo her
  I'll incline her to me
  her feelings besot

is she hot?

  the warmth of her nature
  is sunlight in summer
  her smile alone is a fiery thing
  a telephone call from her
  a forecast of spring
  I'd brave any dark winter
  if only to woo her

telephone? mate, did ya even do 'er?

  would I dare?
  to place me in there
  in her frame
  in a place where I
  might brashly darken
  her burgeoning fame?

that's lame. so you haven't?

  what have I?
  have I what?
  could I be?
  could I not?
  could I hope to raise a thumb
  to her negative space
  which fluctuates
  at scales at which
  my instruments fail?

no tail? you mean you couldn't get it up?

  I am heightened, my cup
  overfloweth, I've dispensed
  with pleasantries
  my peers don't know me hence
  every planetary globe of grass points
  to where I wander on high
  the very air
  my only alibi

did ya even try? grass? you did weed?

  oh hush now you see
  my condition, a weed
  that is innocent
  but for displaced position
  like my feelings did flee
  to be by her bosom, where they
  lost all claim to naivet√©

yeah, right. okay. cool man. that's cool.
