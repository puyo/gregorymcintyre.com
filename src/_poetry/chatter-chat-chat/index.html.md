"What I really want to say" and an image of Brian Brown holding a typewriter

-- Harry and Nicola
```

```poem

words came thick and fast in my past
off the cuff from the pen it was easier then

chatter chat chat went the typewriter flat out
and spat out my words, again and again

chatter chat ding the typewriter would sing
way back then when I sat and kept back not a thing

now many years later I kept the cheese grater
the chatter chat chat is a sound from the past

now many years later it's a sound I can't hear
yet nothing else sounds so sweet to my ear

```
