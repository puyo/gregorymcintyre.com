**Destroyer of Lives**

```poem
She cries and she cries.
Destroyer of lives,
He swallows her love
And feeds her back lies.
```

**The Page of Swords**

```poem
His word is a sword that he holds in his throat.
She asks him to use it but even a note
Could cut her in two so he keeps it in check,
Inside where it cuts him from stomach to neck.
```

**A Story from Inside**

```poem
Locked in a cage he
Sleeps by his guard he
Hurts her with words he
Dreams of the seaside
```
