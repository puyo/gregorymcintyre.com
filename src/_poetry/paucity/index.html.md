```poem
The pitch black of his room
His own raised hand
Floating up, floating down, floating up, floating down
Briney gritty echoes of sand
Flotsam jetsam shadowed underpasses
Coins notes grimy bus stop stares
Stripy shirts thick rimmed glasses
A ringed finger curling a strip of wet hair
Slender fingers on a clerk's cash box
Unbidden compressions of air
```
