Nicole: Joining your own search party
```

```poem
that summer I lost a house and a car
but I kept a bed to hide in for a year

that summer I howled all night like a beast
or I danced all night frenetic and senseless

that summer I caught the bus to see you
and sat with you in the light all the way home

that summer all my friends became pictures
glowing images scrolling silently up

I suppose I did the same trick to them
and they looked around sadly asking themselves

  where is he really?
  we only have his photograph

but you know, I think they knew where I'd gone
that I had opened a tiny door, inside
and had followed myself through it
```
