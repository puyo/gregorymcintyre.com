```poem
I hear them around the corner
high lilting voices
I pause to listen

dog got hit by a car
is he okay?
dad took him to the hos-ti-pal
I mean... the vet
he had blood on his leg
is he gonna be okay?
we have to go back tomorrow
what did your dad say?
nothing
he just looked sad

I round the corner and see them
they see me
small pale faces look up at me as I pass them
their mouths are lines drawn on
```
