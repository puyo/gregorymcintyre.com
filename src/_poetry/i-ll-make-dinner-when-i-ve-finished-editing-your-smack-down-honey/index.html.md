```poem
You take verbage for granite
It's from a whole nother planet
Let my pronounciation orientate
Let it perculate your state
Let my rhymes sooth ya
Do a Heineken remover
Your ordinance is ostensively miniture
I'm gonna take ostraya nucular
You went to the libary supposably?
Your lyrics prespire, depose of them please
Your point is mute the parlament voted
To be pacific what you got's a tradgedy
Your granma and speling expecially
With my volumptuous rhyme
This triathlon bitch
I wan it
```
