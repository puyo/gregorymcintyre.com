```poem

I've been waiting thirty minutes now
For you to go to the bathroom and brush your teeth
Thirty seconds a side
With me poised at the corner waiting
For you raise a cup to your lips
And drink
                        Wind
Tears prick your eyes
                        Passes
You snort
                        From MY BUTTOCKS
A spray of water hits the mirror
Pffffffffffffttttt
Toothpaste flecked mirror, snorting, crying
DAD you scream and dribble
WHAT THE FLIPPING HELL!
