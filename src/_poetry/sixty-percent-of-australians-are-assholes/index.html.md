```poem
Shop about,
Dear Indian student, to learn
A profession's ins and outs.

Don't come to Australia,
We're racists hereâ€”
Xenophobic and ruled by fear.

Take your gap year,
Dear Canadian peers,
Somewhere enlightened.
Of Australia, stay clear. It's weird,
My commonwealth friends, but I note
We torture people who come here by boat.

We send 'em to islands with disease and rapers
And if someone faked papers,
Lord help them! For fleeing
From terror, they've errored.
Now illegal human beings,
People here think the government's not doing enough
To be inhumanely brutally rough.
```
