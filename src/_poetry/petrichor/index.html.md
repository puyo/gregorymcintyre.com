```poem
Ah, love sister
Falling, fragile
You knocked on my door and
Told me it's been raining

Ah, yeah sister
It's been raining here too
And like you
I know
How much it costs to commit
To ten thousand more rainy days

Ah, sweet sister
I'm happy this secret's not strange
What? you demand
Why, sister
You know
Just, how we are both so bloody brave
```
