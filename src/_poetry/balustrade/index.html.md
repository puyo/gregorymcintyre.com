```prompt
Balustrade

Are there more fish in the sea or is it all a big lie?
```

```poem
dose me again this balustrade
i cling to is love is a fool
	is facade
my eye is danger is cavernous night
is elevation is haunted sight
like the one from the top
	of my topple down stairs
hard blood wood pinched short baluster pairs

from this crazy high up i can see
	well love,
just the bottom of the stairs
where i'll be
```
