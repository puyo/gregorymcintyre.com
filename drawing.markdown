I used to study drawing.

Nowadays I simply attend the occasional life drawing course. I recommend the
life drawing courses run at the [WEA](http://www.weasydney.nsw.edu.au) and
those run by [Pina Bartolo](http://www.pinabartolo.com) at the [North Sydney
Community Centre](http://www.northsydneycentre.com.au).

I put some of [my art on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/blue_puyo/tags/art/).
